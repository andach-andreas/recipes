# Vegan Cheese

## Ingredients

* 150g Cashew Nuts (soaked overnight, preferably)
* 40g Nutritional Yeast
* 1tbsp Smoked Paprika
* 1tbsp Maple Syrup
* 1tbsp Agar Agar Powder
* 1 Garlic Clove
* Juice of 1/2 Lemon
* 1/4tsp Turmeric
* 350ml Water
* Pinch of Salt

## Method

1. Put half the water, and all the ingredients except the agar agar powder into a blender and blend until smooth.
2. Put the remaining water into a saucepan, and sprinkle the agar agar powder into it. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. The powder will form a gel - ensure that there are no globules stuck to the bottom.
3. Take off the heat and stir the cashew nut mixture into the saucepan mix. Stir well to ensure it is well mixed.
4. Chill in the fridge for an hour or two.
