    <h1>Sourdough</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>500g White Flour</li>
        <li>380ml Water</li>
        <li>2tsp Salt</li>
        <li>90g Sourdough Starter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Sieve flour into a bowl with the salt.</li>
        <li>Combine the water with the sourdough starter to form a smooth paste.<li>
        <li>Mix together the water mixture and flour to form a sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Leave to rest under a wet tea towel for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Knead for 10 minutes until a soft and elastic dough is achieved. You should be able to stretch it without tearing.</li>
        <li>Leave in a large well-oiled bowl in a warm place for 3 hours to rise.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough briefly to knock the air out of it.</li>
        <li>Put into a large well-oiled bowl and allow it to double in size under a wet tea towel. This will take 4-8 hours at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge. If leaving in the fridge, allow it 1-2 hours at room temperature the morning after.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 230C (210C fan), lightly oil a baking tray and place the dough in the oven for 35-40 minutes until golden brown. Include a tray in the oven with a little water to create steam.</li>
        <li>The dough is done when it sounds hollow at the bottom. Leave for 15 minutes to cool before serving.</li>
    </ul>
